# Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis
This is my finalÂ project for the course; while it may not be useful, it still teaches me how to analysis data. In order to gain insights from the provided data set, I will link the data using the DAX algorithm, visualize it using graphs, and organize it in the clearest possible fashion. As a result, I have identified several elements in this Bank Marketing Campaign dataset that can influence customers' consent to saves, such as:
1. The customer factor: How a current customer can become a future one.
2. Call factor - how to make calls to get more people to sign up for term deposits.
3. Additional considerations - a few additional elements contribute to a rise in clients.
4. Macro factors - Effects of macro factors on consumer growth
Finally, I use slides to communicate insights and present.
